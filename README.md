* ## **Design**
    * **Colour Scheme**
        * As this site is based around expense tracking, the aim was to keep it professional but with a bit of playfulness by adding vibrant color.
        * The background color throughout all pages is a subtly gradient of dark to light purple to add a pop of color.
        * On the landing page, the contrast between the background and the large white image catches the user's eye and draws them in.
        * The use of different grades of purple, and white text with a pop of green and blue buttons makes for a pleasing experience for the user
    * **Typography**
        * 'Segoe UI' font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Roboto, Helvetica, and Arial as the fallback font respectively in case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 'Segoe UI' is a clean, attractive, and appropriate font.
    * **Imagery**
         * On the Landing page, the hero image is bright, white, and large to catch the user's attention. 
         * To the top right of the image is a cup of coffee with cherries and a keyboard and pen. To make for a calming image and an inviting experience.

## Agile Methodology

Each User Story has defined outcome criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. To view User stories click [here](https://github.com/users/kev-n14/projects/8). User stories were moved from Todo -> In Progress -> Done as each user story was completed.

## Data Model

Throughout this project, I've adhered to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and utilized Django's Class-Based Generic Views for efficient development.

The data model of the Expense Tracker application consists of the following entities:

### Account
- Fields: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `username`, `email`, `date_joined`, `last_joined`, `is_admin`, `is_staff`, `is_active`, `is_superadmin`
- This entity manages user accounts and authentication.

### Expenses
- Fields: `id`, `user`, `name`, `amount`, `category`, `date`
- The `Expenses` model records user expenses and is associated with the user account that added them.


<p>The following diagram illustrates the database schema:</p>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dlulkctls/image/upload/v1691270222/readme/db-schema_la9k57.png" alt="ER-diagram" style="width:600px;"/>


## Security Features and Defensive Design
### User Authentication
User authentication is a critical component of the Expense Tracker application's security strategy. The application employs a robust user authentication system that ensures secure access to user accounts and sensitive data.

### Security Measures
The signin function incorporates several security measures to ensure the authentication process is secure:


- **Input Validation:** The function validates the input fields, such as email and password, to prevent common forms of attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

- **Password Hashing:** The function does not store passwords in plain text. Instead, Django's authentication system uses secure password hashing techniques to protect user passwords.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** The auth.authenticate function verifies the provided email and password against the stored credentials in a secure manner. Upon successful authentication, the user is granted access to the application's authorized sections.

- **Session Management:** The use of auth.login establishes a secure user session. Django handles session management, ensuring that session data is protected and session cookies are secure.

- **Error Handling:** The function uses the messages framework to provide user-friendly error messages, helping users understand login failures and providing no hints about the specific cause of failure to potential attackers.

- **Redirects:** In case of successful login, users are securely redirected to the appropriate section of the application. In case of failure, they are redirected back to the login page with an appropriate error message.

**Administrative Security**
- **Django Honeypot Admin:**
To enhance security, the Expense Tracker application utilizes Django Honeypot Admin. This package provides an extra layer of protection against automated attacks and malicious bots. By creating hidden form fields that only bots interact with, Django Honeypot Admin can detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts.

### Conclusion
The user authentication process in the Expense Tracker application is designed with security and defensive measures in mind. By implementing these practices, the application ensures that user accounts and sensitive data are protected from unauthorized access and potential threats.



### Form Validation
The Expense Tracker application employs rigorous form validation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of data submitted. If incorrect or incomplete information is provided in a form, the submission will be prevented, and a user-friendly warning message will be displayed. This message informs users about the specific field that triggered the error, enabling them to correct the issue effectively.

### Database Security
To increase security, sensitive information such as the database URL and secret key are stored within the env.py file. This practice safeguards critical data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
Additionally, the application leverages (CSRF) Cross-Site Request Forgery tokens across all its forms. These tokens serve as a safeguard against malicious attacks, ensuring that requests submitted to the website originate from legitimate sources. By incorporating CSRF tokens, the Expense Tracker application enhances its resistance to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) and request forgery vulnerabilities, bolstering overall security.
