* ### **Design**
    * **Colour Scheme**
        * As this site is based around expense tracking, the aim was to keep it professional but with a bit of playfulness by adding vibrant color.
        * The background color throughout all pages is a subtly gradient of dark to light purple to add a pop of color.
        * On the landing page, the contrast between the background and the large white image catches the user's eye and draws them in.
        * The use of different grades of purple, and white text with a pop of green and blue buttons makes for a pleasing experience for the user
    * **Typography**

## Agile Methodology

Each User Story has defined outcome criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. To view User stories click [here](https://github.com/users/kev-n14/projects/8). User stories were moved from Todo -> In Progress -> Done as each user story was completed.


## Security Features and Defensive Design
### User Authentication
- I used Django AllAuth for the user authentication system. For users to sign up, log in and log out.

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error message. 

### Database Security
The database URL and secret key are stored in the env.py file.
(CSRF) Cross-Site Request Forgery tokens were used on all forms throughout this website.
